"""Turns handwheel motion into jog messages.

Sits between the encoder and the link. Accumulated detents are coalesced and
emitted on a fixed tick rather than sent per click, because a 100 PPR wheel
spun hard produces ~500 clicks/s and one message each would flood the link for
no gain - the sender cannot act on them faster than it dispatches anyway.

Tick rate is deliberately set well inside the sender's own jog interval. The
GrblHAL Sender dispatches proportional jogs every 75 ms; a scheduler here
running slower than that would add a second, unsynchronised quantiser on top,
and the two would compound into far more delay than either alone. At 50 Hz
this contributes ~10 ms average and the sender's existing coalescing does the
real work.

Jog cancel is sent once when motion stops, and again whenever the axis changes
mid-motion, so a partially executed jog on the old axis does not continue after
the operator has moved on.
